# @Chatflows/react

This library provides a framework for building and managing chatbots using the concept of chatflows. Each message in the chatbot is part of a specific flow, and as the user interacts with the bot, different flows are triggered based on their inputs.

A chatflow is a sequence of messages and actions that guide the conversation. The library allows you to design flexible and dynamic chatbot experiences by organizing these messages into distinct flows, ensuring that the conversation adapts to the user's responses in real-time.

With this library, developers can easily create complex chatbot interactions that respond intelligently to user input, enabling smooth transitions between different conversational pathways without the need for rigid, linear scripting.
